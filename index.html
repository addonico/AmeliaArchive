                  A gradual process of mapping, abstraction, and analysis was
                  carried out on the study domain and each individual item.

                              Amelia Earhart is celebrated as a pioneering
                              aviator and a symbol of courage and innovation in
                              aviation history. Born in 1897, she developed a
                              passion for flying at a young age and quickly made
                              a name for herself in a male-dominated field. In
                              1932, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo
                              across the Atlantic Ocean, a feat that earned her
                              international acclaim and the nickname "Lady
                              Lindy." Her daring flights challenged societal
                              norms and inspired countless women to pursue
                              careers in aviation and beyond. Earhart's ambition
                              didn't stop there. She set numerous records and
                              became the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to
                              California. Her contributions extended beyond
                              aviation; she was a vocal advocate for women's
                              rights and an active member of the Ninety-Nines,
                              an organization that supported female pilots. Her
                              legacy is a testament to her determination to
                              break barriers and redefine what was possible for
                              women of her time. In 1937, during an attempt to
                              circumnavigate the globe, Earhart and her
                              navigator, Fred Noonan, vanished over the Pacific
                              Ocean. Despite extensive search efforts, they were
                              never found, leaving behind one of history's most
                              enduring mysteries. Amelia Earhart’s life and
                              mysterious disappearance continue to captivate and
                              inspire people worldwide, embodying the spirit of
                              adventure and the relentless pursuit of dreams. <br>
                              <br>Our project is to focus on this idea: Amelia Earhart’s 
                              personal items and archival documents about her 
                              stored in museums and libraries. These items can 
                              mostly express the career life and achievements 
                              of Amelia Earhart, including her personal equipments, 
                              aircraft, autobiography, medals awarded, and archival 
                              documents about her. We aim to collect these items in 
                              a linked open data environment, and develop an open 
                              data model that connects all the items related to 
                              Amelia Earhart’s life archive, in which we adopted 
                              Semantic Web methods such as ontologies, RDF and URIs.

                                The Lockheed Aircraft Company introduced the
                                Lockheed Vega 5b in 1927, and it soon became a
                                pilots' favorite. Aviators like Wiley Post (the
                                first pilot to fly solo around the world),
                                Jimmie Mattern and Jacqueline Cochran soon began
                                flying with this aircraft. Amelia Earhart bought
                                her first Vega 5b (her "Little Red Bus") in 1930
                                and set two records while flying in: in May
                                1932, she became the first woman to fly solo
                                across the Atlantic, and not much later, in
                                August of the same year, she flew solo and
                                nonstop from Los Angeles to Newark, becoming the
                                first woman to do so.

                                In the 1930s, Amelia Earhart designed a
                                two-piece, cotton-made flying suit for the
                                Ninety-Nines. The piece was never adopted as an
                                official suit of the organization, but the
                                stylized logo was kept. In the same years,
                                Amelia experimented with designing her own line
                                of clothes, called "Amelia Fashions". Her
                                clothes were supposed to be comfortable and
                                wrinkle-free and adopted unusual materials, like
                                parachute silk or fabric used for airplane
                                wings.

                                On September 22, 1929, an interview of Amelia
                                Earhart was published in the Evening Star. In
                                the article, written by Eve G. Grady, the
                                aviatrix fights for more opportunities for women
                                pilots, arguing against the prejudices that used
                                to see young women as not suited for "dangerous"
                                activities such flying.

                                We have then created the CSV files, one per each

                                production. Firstly, we have minted the required
                                URIs: we have created one URI for item, plus the
                                URIs to identify important people, organizations
                                and additional resources.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Then, we have created the RDF triples and its
                                related turtle serialization, focusing on the
                                resources and on the items related to Amelia
                                Earhart’s records of 1928 and 1932. When possible,
                                we have aligned our resources with links coming
                                from VIAF, GEONAMES and Wikidata. To enrich our
                                dataset, we have used the properties owl:sameAs,
                                foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf and SKOS:broader.
